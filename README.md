## Crappy Bird Application

<br/>

## Modification of Flappy Bird with the following features:

- 2 birds instead of 1 with threads/synchronised mutex and parallel operations for a multiplayer challenge
- Scoreboard to keep track (may not work locally as it needs connection to AWS)
- OS customization to hide the status bar

## Installation

1) Simply clone this repository. 
2) It is recommended to write and debug your code with a physical hardware, rather than a
virtual simulator device. In case you use a simulator, you can use the following configuration
as a baseline:
- Nexus 6P device (API level 30);
- CPU with 4 cores,
- RAM: 1536MB,
- Storage: 512MB,
- Screen resolution: 1440x2560 at 560dpi
